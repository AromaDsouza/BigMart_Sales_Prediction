# "Predicting Product Sales for BigMart Stores Using Machine Learning Techniques"

# Overview:
This project aims to accurately predict the sales of individual products at various BigMart stores using machine learning models based on the given product and store attributes.

# Project Objectives:
1.	To create machine learning models that accurately predict the sales of individual products at different BigMart stores by utilizing historical sales data and various product and store attributes.
2.	To analyze sales patterns and customer preferences to offer recommendations for product placement, store layout, and stocking strategies, improving overall store performance and customer satisfaction.

# Summary of Project and Background:
BigMart, a large retail chain, operates multiple stores across various cities. To enhance its operations, BigMart aims to understand and predict the sales patterns of different products in various stores. The dataset at hand contains sales data from 2013 for 1559 products across 10 different stores. Each product and store is described by several attributes, which include both categorical and numerical features.

# Dataset: 
The dataset used for this project is taken from Kaggle and is provided in CSV format. The training dataset contains 8,523 records and the test dataset contains 5,681 records
